                <h3>IMMIGRATION</h3>
                <p><strong>
                    Focus on pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and humane conditions for immigrants.
                    This stance is taken because of the large LatinX population in Arizona, which is filled with immigrants, specifically from Mexico (89% of Arizona LatinX population).
                </strong></p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        This country was founded on the dreams of immigrants trying to make a better life for themselves.
                        It has been that way for the past 247 years, and should continue to remain so.
                        Every day people flee situations of desperation from their home country, and America remains a shining light for their future, and the future of their families.
                        Let us embrace them, not throw them into detention centers, separating parent from child, so that they can have the future that they have wanted, the American dream, open for all.
                        It has been proven time and time again that immigrants are essential for the economic growth of this country.
                        However, they need the necessary tools to do so.
                        We should offer pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, who bring with them a desire to work and contribute to our society, core values of America, so that we can all prosper and build the future.
                    </p>

                <h3>HEALTHCARE</h3>
                <p><strong>
                    It is a fundamental human right. Increase accessibility to healthcare that is affordable and provides all people with the care they deserve.
                    This is a fundamental policy of democratically-aligned politicians today.
                </strong></p>
                <p>
                    Just like life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, healthcare is a human right. For how can you have any of those without it?
                    My opponents across the stage would rather see the effects of another Covid-19 pandemic than take the extra measures to stop it in its tracks.
                    However, it is important to use what we already have in this system and mold it to what our state needs.
                    If you already have healthcare, good! If you don’t, let's work to get that for you.
                    Additionally, the people of Arizona should not be forced to shell out $700 for a life-saving epipen each year, which they may not even use.
                    Let’s tackle inflated healthcare prices from the inside out, starting with the drug companies that think they can charge whatever they want.
                    All in all, we want to make sure that everyone has access to affordable healthcare, and also that hospitals and primary care facilities have the ability to tackle any and all healthcare crises they face.

                <h3>INFRASTRUCTURE</h3>
                <p><strong>
                    Increase investment in infrastructure that will stimulate economic growth and stability, as well as protecting the blue-collar jobs.
                    This is because Arizona (20%) has more blue-collar workers than the national average (13%).
                </strong></p>
                <p>
                    The first actions President Biden took in office were for the infrastructure of our economy and to increase the pay of union workers.
                    When I gain this senate seat, I will fight no different.
                    Blue-collar workers represent the backbone of this nation, and they are paramount to the infrastructure we need to succeed in the future.
                    I will fight to increase their pay, and instead of funding companies like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin to develop better planes for our stationary military, we should focus that money right here in the US, building more infrastructure that improves the lives of the people.
                    Building more efficient roads, buildings, and power supplies will do more good for the people than developing nuclear weapons, so I say we focus on innovating the infrastructure of the United States to better the lives of all.
